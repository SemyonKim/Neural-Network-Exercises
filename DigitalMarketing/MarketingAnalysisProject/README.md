\# 📘 Project Overview



The notebook demonstrates:

* \*\*Data Loading \& Preparation\*\*  

Handling multiple datasets (features, sales, stores) and preparing them for analysis.

* \*\*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\*\*

&nbsp;	- Store type distribution (pie chart)

&nbsp;	- Weekly sales comparison: holiday vs. non‑holiday

&nbsp;	- Time series plots of temperature, fuel price, and weekly sales across stores

&nbsp;	- Pairplots and categorical plots with Seaborn

* \*\*Machine Learning Models\*\*

&nbsp;	- K‑Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Classifies store types based on features

&nbsp;	- Linear Regression: Predicts weekly sales from store attributes

&nbsp;	- Error diagnostics: confusion matrix, misclassification counts, train/test MSE comparison

* \*\*Key Findings\*\*

&nbsp;	- Store type strongly influences sales distribution

&nbsp;	- Holidays impact weekly sales averages

&nbsp;	- Simple ML models can capture store‑type classification with high accuracy
