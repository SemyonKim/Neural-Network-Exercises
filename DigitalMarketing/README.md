\# Digital Marketing Course Notebooks



This folder contains three notebooks from my academic course on Digital Marketing.  

We processed, analyzed, visualized data, and made predictions using both classic algorithms and neural network approaches.



\## 📂 Contents

\- \*\*DM\_Sales\_Stores.ipynb\*\*  

&nbsp; Exercise on sales and stores data. Includes visualization, classification via KNeighborsClassifier, and prediction via LinearRegression.



\- \*\*DM\_TimeSeries\_Panel.ipynb\*\*  

&nbsp; Combined solutions notebook on time series and panel data. Implements LSTM, ARIMA models, PooledOLS fixed/random effects estimator, and RNN approach.



\- \*\*DM\_Analysis\_Combined.ipynb\*\*  

&nbsp; Combined solutions notebook for clustering, classification, and regression/prediction problems.  

&nbsp; Includes classic methods (K-means, hierarchical clustering, random forest, decision tree, logistic regression, linear regression, SVR, Poisson, Negative-Binomial) and neural network approaches (SOM/miniSOM, MLP classifier, MLP regressor).
