# Digital Marketing Course Notebooks

This folder contains three completed projects from the academic course on **Digital Marketing**. Each notebook demonstrates how classical machine learning methods and neural network approaches can be applied to marketing and academic datasets, with clear documentation, structured workflows, and interpretive insights.
