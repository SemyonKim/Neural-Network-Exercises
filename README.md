## 📖 Overview
This repository contains a collection of **neural network exercises** implemented in **Python notebooks** during my university coursework.  
Exercises range from **basic concepts** (perceptron, activation functions) to **medium-level implementations** (multi-layer networks, backpropagation, convolutional examples).  
Each notebook includes **visualizations** of training results for clarity.

## 📂 Structure
- **basic/** → introductory exercises (perceptron, activation functions, gradient descent).  
- **medium/** → intermediate topics (multi-layer networks, backpropagation, convolutional examples).  
- **visualization/** → training curves, accuracy plots.  
- **utils/** → helper functions for reuse.  

---

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory  
- Libraries:
   - `numpy`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `scikit-learn`
   - `scikit-learn` (in some exercises)
   - `tensorflow` (for some exercises)

⚠️ **Note**: These notebooks were created during university coursework. Dependencies may vary between files, and not all notebooks have been tested recently.

---

## 🚀 Usage
- This repository is an **archive of my university exercises**.
- Each .ipynb notebook demonstrates a specific algorithm or neural network concept.
- You are welcome to open the notebooks in **Jupyter** or **Google Colab** to explore the code and visualizations.
- Since this is an archive, some notebooks may require adjustments to run correctly in modern environments.

---

## 📌 Notes
- This project is an **academic exercise archive**.
- It is **not actively maintained**, but preserved for reference and learning.
- Future updates may include documentation of my **Bachelor/Master thesis experiments**.
