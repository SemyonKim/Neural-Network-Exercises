## 📖 Overview
This repository is an **archived collection** of selected works from my university coursework in neural networks, implemented in **Python notebooks**.  
Exercises range from **basic concepts** (perceptron, activation functions) to **medium-level implementations** (multi-layer networks, backpropagation, convolutional examples).  

---

## 📂 Structure
- **basic/** → introductory exercises (perceptron, activation functions, gradient descent).  
- **medium/** → intermediate topics (multi-layer networks, backpropagation, convolutional examples).  
- **visualization/** → training curves, accuracy plots.  
- **utils/** → helper functions for reuse.

## 📂 Contents

### Basic Level
- **[digit_recognition_constant.ipynb](basic/digit_recognition_constant.ipynb)**  
  Trivial baseline classifier that always predicts the same digit.  
  *Problem solved:* Demonstrates dataset loading and evaluation pipeline, even though accuracy is ~10%.

- **[digit_recognition_quadrant.ipynb](basic/digit_recognition_quadrant.ipynb)**  
  Rule-based classifier dividing digit images into quadrants and comparing pixel counts.  
  *Problem solved:* Shows feature engineering and manual classification logic, achieving ~29% accuracy.

### Medium Level
- **[iou_and_polygon_area.ipynb](medium/iou_and_polygon_area.ipynb)** Demonstrates geometric computations: Intersection over Union (IoU) between rectangles and polygon area calculation using Shapely.
*Problem solved:* Introduces bounding box overlap metrics (IoU) widely used in computer vision, and shows how to compute polygon areas programmatically.
- *(to be added: multi-layer networks, backpropagation, convolutional examples)*

### Visualization
- *(to be added: training curves, accuracy plots)*

### Utilities
- *(to be added: helper functions for reuse)*

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory  
- Libraries:
   - Core: `numpy`, `matplotlib`
   - ML/NN: `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`

> ⚠️ **Note**: These notebooks were created during university coursework. Dependencies may vary between files, and not all notebooks have been tested recently.

---

## 🚀 Usage
- Each .ipynb notebook demonstrates a specific algorithm or neural network concept.
- You are welcome to open the notebooks in **Jupyter** or **Google Colab** to explore the code and visualizations.
- Since this is an archive, some notebooks may require adjustments to run correctly in modern environments.

## 📌 Notes
- This project is an **academic exercise archive**.
- It is **not actively maintained**, but preserved for reference and learning.
- Future updates may include documentation of my **Bachelor/Master thesis experiments**.
