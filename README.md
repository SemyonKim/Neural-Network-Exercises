## 📖 Overview
This repository contains a collection of **neural network exercises** implemented in **Python notebooks** during my university coursework.  
Exercises range from **basic concepts** (perceptron, activation functions) to **medium-level implementations** (multi-layer networks, backpropagation, convolutional examples).  
Each notebook includes **visualizations** of training results for clarity.

## 📂 Structure
- **basic/** → introductory exercises (perceptron, activation functions, gradient descent).  
- **medium/** → intermediate topics (multi-layer networks, backpropagation, convolutional examples).  
- **visualization/** → training curves, accuracy plots.  
- **utils/** → helper functions for reuse.

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory  
- Libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow` (for some exercises)  

---

## 🚀 Usage
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SemyonKim/Neural-Network-Exercises.git
   ```
1. Open a notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.
1. Run the cells to explore the algorithm and visualize results.
