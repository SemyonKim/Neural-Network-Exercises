## 📖 Overview
This repository is an **archived collection** of selected works from my university coursework in neural networks, implemented in **Python notebooks**.  
Exercises range from **basic concepts** (perceptron, activation functions) to **medium-level implementations** (multi-layer networks, backpropagation, convolutional examples), and extend into **advanced cooperative learning experiments** inspired by [NeurIPS 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04606) research.  

It also includes a dedicated block on **Digital Marketing analytics**, a project on **synthetic license plate generation and recognition**, and a full archive of the **Python & Machine Learning [SHARE](https://sharemsu.ru/) program**.
Finally, the **NumericalMethods** folder contains my coursework on Optimisations and Numerical Methods, covering regression, dimensionality reduction, integration, and optimization techniques.
