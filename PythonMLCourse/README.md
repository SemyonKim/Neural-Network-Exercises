# PythonMLCourse

## 📖 Overview
The `PythonMLCourse` folder contains a complete archive of the **Python & Machine Learning course** from the [SHARE](https://sharemsu.ru/) program.  
It includes all seminars, competitions, and a consolidated notebook, covering both **fundamental concepts** and **applied machine learning techniques**.  
This archive serves as a structured reference for learning Python programming, data preprocessing, classical ML models, and introductory deep learning with PyTorch.

---

## 📂 Structure
- **Part1/** → Fundamentals + competitions
  - 8 seminars + 2 competitions.
  - Topics: Python basics, data preprocessing, linear/logistic regression, decision trees, handling missing values, and early ML challenges.
- **Part2/** → Applied ML & advanced topics
  - 8 seminars (including 1 competition).
  - Topics: feature engineering, ensemble methods, PyTorch models, image classification with augmentation, advanced regression tasks.
- **PythonMLCourse.ipynb** → Consolidated notebook combining all seminars and competitions into one file for quick review.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Provide a **complete learning archive** for Python and machine learning coursework.  
- Demonstrate **step-by-step progression** from fundamentals to applied ML.  
- Offer **competition-style exercises** to simulate real-world problem solving.  
- Serve as a **reference notebook** for future projects and advanced studies.
